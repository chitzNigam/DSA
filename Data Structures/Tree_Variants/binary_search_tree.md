# 🔍 Binary Search Tree (BST)

## 🔍 What is it?
A **Binary Search Tree** is a binary tree where:
- Left child < node
- Right child > node

## ✅ Key Operations
- `insert(x)`
- `delete(x)`
- `search(x)`
- `findMin()`
- `findMax()`
- `inorderTraversal()` (returns sorted order)

## 📚 Use Cases
- Dynamic set operations (insert, delete, search)
- Dictionary/map implementations
- Range queries

## 📝 Notes
- Time complexity: O(log n) average, O(n) worst case
- Can become unbalanced; self-balancing variants exist
