# 🌊 BFS Traversal (Breadth-First Search)

## 🔍 What is it?
**Breadth-First Search (BFS)** explores the graph level by level, visiting all neighbors of a node before moving deeper.

## ✅ Key Operations
- `bfs(start)` – Uses a queue to explore nodes layer by layer

## 📚 Use Cases
- Finding shortest path in unweighted graphs
- Level-order traversal of trees

## 📝 Notes
- Time Complexity: O(V + E)
- Queue-based implementation
