# 🌲 DFS Traversal (Depth-First Search)

## 🔍 What is it?
**Depth-First Search (DFS)** explores graph nodes by going as deep as possible along one branch before backtracking.

## ✅ Key Operations
- `dfs(start)` – Visits all nodes reachable from the start node using recursion or a stack

## 📚 Use Cases
- Cycle detection
- Topological sorting
- Finding connected components

## 📝 Notes
- Time Complexity: O(V + E)
- Can be implemented recursively or iteratively using a stack
