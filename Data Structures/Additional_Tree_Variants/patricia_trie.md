# 🌲 Patricia Trie

## 🔍 What is it?
A **Patricia Trie** (Practical Algorithm To Retrieve Information Coded In Alphanumeric) is a compressed version of a binary trie, where common prefixes are merged to save space.

## ✅ Key Operations
- `insert(word)`
- `search(word)`
- `delete(word)`

## 📚 Use Cases
- IP routing (e.g., longest prefix matching)
- Efficient prefix lookups

## 📝 Notes
- Space-efficient for sparse binary tries
- Suitable for strings and binary representations
