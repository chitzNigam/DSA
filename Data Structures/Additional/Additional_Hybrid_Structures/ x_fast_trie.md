## 🔍 What is it?
A trie-based structure designed to perform predecessor/successor queries in `O(log log U)` time, where `U` is the universe size.

## ✅ Key Operations
- Predecessor
- Successor

## 📚 Use Cases
- Fast navigation in bounded integer domains

## 📝 Notes
- High space usage due to hashing at each level
