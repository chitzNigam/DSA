# 🧠 Van Emde Boas Layout

## 🔍 What is it?
A memory layout for binary trees that improves cache efficiency by arranging nodes in a cache-oblivious order.

## ✅ Key Operations
- Fast binary search traversal
- Better locality of reference

## 📚 Use Cases
- Memory-constrained environments
- Applications requiring frequent tree traversal

## 📝 Notes
- Not a data structure by itself, but an optimization
- Often applied to segment trees or other binary trees
