# 🧠 2D Binary Indexed Tree (BIT)

## 🔍 What is it?
An extension of the Fenwick Tree to two dimensions for efficient 2D range queries.

## ✅ Key Operations
- `update(x, y, delta)`
- `query(x1, y1, x2, y2)`

## 📚 Use Cases
- Matrix-based range sum queries
- Image processing
- 2D games and simulations

## 📝 Notes
- Complexity: `O(log n * log m)`
