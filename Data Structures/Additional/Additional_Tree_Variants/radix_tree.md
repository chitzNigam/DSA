# 🌲 Radix Tree (Compact Prefix Tree)

## 🔍 What is it?
A **Radix Tree**, also known as a Compact Prefix Tree, merges nodes in a standard trie that have only one child. It stores substrings instead of single characters to improve space efficiency.

## ✅ Key Operations
- `insert(word)`
- `search(word)`
- `delete(word)`

## 📚 Use Cases
- Auto-completion
- IP routing
- Efficient string indexing

## 📝 Notes
- Combines properties of hash maps and tries
- Improves memory efficiency by reducing nodes
