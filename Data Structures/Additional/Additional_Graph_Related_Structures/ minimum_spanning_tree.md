# 🌐 Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)

## 🔍 What is it?
A **Minimum Spanning Tree** is a subgraph that connects all vertices in a graph with the minimum possible total edge weight and without any cycles.

## ✅ Key Operations
- `kruskal_mst(graph)`
- `prim_mst(graph)`

## 📚 Use Cases
- Network design (e.g., telecom, electrical grids)
- Approximation algorithms
- Cluster analysis

## 📝 Notes
- Only applicable to connected, weighted, undirected graphs
- There may be multiple MSTs with the same total weight
