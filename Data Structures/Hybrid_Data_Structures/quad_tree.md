## 🔍 What is it?
A **Quad Tree** is a tree structure used for partitioning a 2D space into four quadrants recursively.

## ✅ Key Operations
- `insert(point)`
- `query(range)`
- `subdivide()`

## 📚 Use Cases
- 2D spatial indexing
- Collision detection
- Image processing

## 📝 Notes
- Depth depends on spatial distribution
- Effective for sparse 2D data
