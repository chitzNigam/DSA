# 🎛️ Discretization (Coordinate Compression)

## 🔍 What is it?
**Discretization** transforms a wide range of values into a compact integer space while preserving order.

## ✅ Key Operations
- `compress(values)` – Maps original values to indices in sorted order

## 📚 Use Cases
- Segment trees/Fenwick trees
- Range queries over large coordinate spaces

## 📝 Notes
- Common in competitive programming
- Used when input values are large but limited in number
