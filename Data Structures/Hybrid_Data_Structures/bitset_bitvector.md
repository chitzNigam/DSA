# 🧮 BitSet / Bit Vector

## 🔍 What is it?
A **BitSet** (or **Bit Vector**) is a compact array of bits (0s and 1s) used for efficient memory operations and binary flag tracking.

## ✅ Key Operations
- `set(i)`
- `clear(i)`
- `get(i)`

## 📚 Use Cases
- Flags and filters
- Memory-efficient boolean arrays
- Sieve of Eratosthenes

## 📝 Notes
- Space: O(n) bits instead of O(n) bytes
- Can perform fast bitwise operations
