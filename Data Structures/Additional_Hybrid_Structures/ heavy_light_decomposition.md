# 🧠 Heavy-Light Decomposition (HLD)

## 🔍 What is it?
**Heavy-Light Decomposition** is a tree decomposition technique to break down a tree into paths to allow efficient path queries and updates (e.g., path sum, path max).

## ✅ Key Operations
- `decompose_tree()`
- `query_path(u, v)`
- `update_path(u, v, value)`

## 📚 Use Cases
- Range queries over trees
- Lowest common ancestor (LCA) optimizations
- Dynamic programming on trees

## 📝 Notes
- Often used with Segment Trees or Binary Indexed Trees
- Important in advanced graph problems
