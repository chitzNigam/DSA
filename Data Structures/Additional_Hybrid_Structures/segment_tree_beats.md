# 🧠 Segment Tree Beats

## 🔍 What is it?
**Segment Tree Beats** is an advanced form of segment tree that handles complex range queries such as range max/min updates and custom aggregations more efficiently than standard lazy propagation.

## ✅ Key Operations
- `range_update()`
- `range_query()`

## 📚 Use Cases
- Competitive programming
- Complex range minimum/maximum operations
- Conditional segment updates

## 📝 Notes
- Not as commonly implemented outside of performance-critical scenarios
- Requires careful implementation to avoid performance degradation
