# 🚀 Skip List

## 🔍 What is it?
A **Skip List** is a probabilistic data structure built on layered linked lists, allowing fast search, insertion, and deletion in O(log n) average time.

## ✅ Key Operations
- `insert(x)`
- `delete(x)`
- `search(x)`

## 📚 Use Cases
- Ordered maps/sets
- In-memory indexing (e.g., Redis)

## 📝 Notes
- Simpler than balanced trees
- Supports logarithmic time operations probabilistically
