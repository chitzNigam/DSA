# 📈 Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree)

## 🔍 What is it?
A tree-based structure to compute prefix sums efficiently.

## ✅ Key Operations
- `update(i, delta)`
- `query(i)` – sum of first i elements

## 📚 Use Cases
- Inversion count
- Range updates and queries

## 📝 Notes
- Time: O(log n)
- Space: O(n)
- Easier to implement than Segment Tree
