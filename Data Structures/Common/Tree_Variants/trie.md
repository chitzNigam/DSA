# 🔡 Trie (Prefix Tree)

## 🔍 What is it?
A **Trie** is a tree-based data structure used to store strings. Each node represents a character, and paths from root to leaves form words.

## ✅ Key Operations
- `insert(word)`
- `search(word)`
- `startsWith(prefix)`

## 📚 Use Cases
- Auto-completion
- Spell-checking
- IP routing (prefix matching)

## 📝 Notes
- Time complexity: O(L), where L is length of word
- Space-intensive but fast for retrieval
