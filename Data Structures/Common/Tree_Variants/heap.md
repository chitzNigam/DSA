# 🛠️ Heap (Binary Heap)

## 🔍 What is it?
A **Heap** is a complete binary tree that satisfies the **heap property**:
- **Min Heap**: parent ≤ children
- **Max Heap**: parent ≥ children

## ✅ Key Operations
- `insert(x)`
- `extractMin()` / `extractMax()`
- `heapify()`
- `peek()`

## 📚 Use Cases
- Priority queues
- Scheduling algorithms
- Heap sort

## 📝 Notes
- Usually implemented as an array
- Not suitable for search operations
