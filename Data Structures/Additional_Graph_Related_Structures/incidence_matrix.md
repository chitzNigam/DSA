# 🌐 Incidence Matrix

## 🔍 What is it?
An **Incidence Matrix** is a way of representing a graph using a 2D matrix where rows represent vertices and columns represent edges. A cell indicates whether a vertex is incident (connected) to an edge.

## ✅ Key Operations
- `build_matrix(graph)`
- `is_incident(vertex, edge)`

## 📚 Use Cases
- Graph algorithms requiring edge-node relationships
- Electrical circuit modeling

## 📝 Notes
- Less space-efficient for sparse graphs
- Useful for certain theoretical graph computations
