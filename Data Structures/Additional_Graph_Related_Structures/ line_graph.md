# 🌐 Line Graph

## 🔍 What is it?
A **Line Graph** is a graph transformation where each vertex in the line graph represents an edge in the original graph. Two vertices in the line graph are connected if their corresponding edges share a common endpoint.

## ✅ Key Operations
- `generate_line_graph(G)`

## 📚 Use Cases
- Network flow and routing problems
- Social and transportation networks

## 📝 Notes
- Useful for edge-centric analysis
- Not all graphs have line graphs that are also line graphs of some other graph
