# 🧱 `enum` (Enumeration)

## 🔍 What is it?
An `enum` defines a set of **named constant values**. It helps make code more readable by giving meaningful names to numbers.

## 🧠 Purpose
- Represent fixed sets of related constants (e.g., days, directions, states).
- Improve code clarity over numeric constants.

## 📦 Example (C)

```c
enum Day { MON, TUE, WED, THU, FRI, SAT, SUN };
