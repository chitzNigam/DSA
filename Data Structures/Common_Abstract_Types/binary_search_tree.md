# 🌲 Binary Search Tree (BST)

## 🔍 What is it?
A **BST** is a binary tree where:
- Left child < Parent
- Right child > Parent

## 🧠 Key Operations
- `insert(x)`
- `delete(x)`
- `search(x)`

## 📚 Use Cases
- Sorted data access
- Searching in logarithmic time
- Range queries

## 📝 Notes
- In-order traversal = sorted output
- Unbalanced BST can degrade to linked list (O(n) ops)
- Self-balancing versions: AVL, Red-Black Tree
